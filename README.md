# Vision
This Project is brought to you by the combined efforts of Andres, Felix, Neysha, and Vivianna.

The purpose of this project is to create a device that can communicate using light signals wirelessly at a distance. The device will be marketed for military applications because light/laser communication is much harder to detect or intefere with and this device would allow for communications to continue even when radio silence is necessary. This device eliminates the risks of radio communications that modern advosaries can detect, jam, hack, or triangulate to discover the position of allied forces. The device will be using technology similar to the pentagon's current TALON project. TALON or Tactical Line-of-Sight Communications Network, is a device that can send signals up to 45 miles. Our vision for this project to to have a device that is more portable and useful for troop-to-troop communications.
